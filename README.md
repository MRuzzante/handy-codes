# handy-codes
This is a repository of tiny very-easy-to-forget do files to perform simple and common tasks of data cleaning and analysis.

In order to use any of these codes, use the command `include` in Stata and specify the URL of the required do-file.
E.g.:

`include "https://raw.githubusercontent.com/MRuzzante/handy-codes/master/stata/portuguese_characters.do"`
